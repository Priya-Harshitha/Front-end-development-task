Task Manager — Web Application
This is a responsive Task Manager project developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It helps users create, manage, and organize tasks easily from their web browser.

The tasks are saved in LocalStorage, so users will not lose their tasks even after refreshing or closing the page.
